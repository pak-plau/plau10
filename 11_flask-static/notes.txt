  Test the usage of a static folder
2020-10-13

Predictions:
- Predicted that http://localhost:5000/static/foo would produce the same results as running  http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html

During the initial run of app.py,
the __name__ of this module is...
__main__
is printed in the terminal and No hablo queso! is printed on the web.

Running http://localhost:5000/static/foo generates a download of foo.
Running  http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html results in a webpage with “this here some plaintext tho” written.
