MongoDB stores data in JSON and BSON files
    - JSON (JavaScript Standard Object Notation)
        - Start and end with {}
        - Separate each key and value with :
        - Separate each key:value pair with ,
        - "keys" must be surrounded with ""
        - "keys" = "fields"
        - Pros: friendly, readable, familiar
        - Cons: text-based, space-consuming, limited data types
    - BSON (Binary JSON)
        - Invented to bridge the gap between binary representation and JSON format
        - Optimized for speed, space, flexibility
        - High performance with a general-purpose focus
        - Encoding is Binary instead of UFT-8 String for JSON
        - Supports more data types that JSON
        - Readability is machine only
        - MongoDB stores data using BSON
            - But JSON can still be used
mongodump (exports data in BSON)
mongoexport (exports data in JSON)
URI string (Uniform Resource Identifier)
    - srv - establishes a secure connection
mongorestore (imports data in BSON dump)
mongoimport (imports data in JSON)
find() (finds information in collections)
it (iterates through a cursor, which is a pointer to a set of a query)
pretty() (makes data easier to read)
