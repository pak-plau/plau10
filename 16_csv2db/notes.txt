- IF NOT EXISTS - use it with CREATE TABLE so we don't run into the error of creating a table that already exists
- OR IGNORE - use it with INSERT so that we don't insert duplicate error
    - if the insert returns an error, it doesn't run the insert command
- when giving a text value to insert, surround it with '' or errors occur
