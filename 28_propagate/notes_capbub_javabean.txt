/1
- alert(); gives a dialog box
- since there are multiple td elements, each one was assigned an EventListener

/2
- when the user clicks on a cell, three dialog boxes show up in succession, in the order of cell, row, table

/3
- the third argument for .addEventListener() is a boolean that dictates whether or not to use capturing
- if there is a mix of capturing and bubbling, capturing happens first, then bubbling
    - the order for version 3 was table, cell, row
- e.stopPropagation() only lets the first EventListener to respond to a given event (the table gets put in a dialog box, but not the row and cell)

/4
- order in which the EventListener are put into the js file does not affect the order the EventListeners are activated in (capturing, then bubbling)
