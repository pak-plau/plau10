#Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
If we remove render_template, we can still run http://127.0.0.1:5000/, but not http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument?

return render_template( 'model_tmplt.html', foo="fooooo", collection=coll)

'model_tmplt.html' is a html file. The title of the webpage is assigned to foo. The body of the html states for each item in collection, print the item, next line. {% endfor %} signals to loop.

Question: Why is it “model_tmplt.html” instead of “templates/model_tmplt.html” since app.py and model_tmplt.html aren’t on the same level of the directory? Is the templates folder the folder render_template looks for files?

We set foo="fooooo" which results in the webpage being named “fooooo”
We set collection=coll, a list defined in app.py as [0,1,1,2,3,5,8].
The web page printed each number in the list (going in order of index), each on a new line.
