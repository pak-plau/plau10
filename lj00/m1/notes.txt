database - structured way to store and access data
MongoDB is a NoSQL database
    - No related tables of data
        - No rows or columns
    - Data is stored as documents
    - Documents are stored in collections
MongoDB Atlas helps with data storage and retrieval
    - Uses clusters (a group of servers that stores your data)
        - Replica set (a few connected MongoDB instances that store the same data)
            - If a server fails, the other servers have the information ready to use
    - Manages cluster creation
    - Runs and maintains database deployment
    - Uses cloud service provider of your choice
    - Allows you to experiment with new tools and features
