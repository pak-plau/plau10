- Aggregation framework - another way to query data in MongoDB
    - use .aggregate() instead of .find()
    - .aggregate() take in an array and works like a pipeline
    - {$match: {"amenities":"Wifi"}}, filters out files that don't have Wifi as an amenity
    - {$project: {"price": 1, "address": 1, "_id": 0}}, show only the price and address and exclude the id
    - $group takes in a stream of data and puts it into different distinct reservoirs
    - {$group:
        {
            _id: "$address.country", // Group By Expression
            <field1>: {<accumulator1> : <expression1>},
            ...
        }}
        - groups all of the files with the same country into one file (helps shows how many distinct countries there are)
- .sort() is a cursor method (applied not to data, but to a stream of it) (.find().sort())
- .limit() limits sort to a certain number of results (show only the top 3, or top 5)
- we can use indexes to speed up queries
    - .createIndex({"birth year": 1}) creates an index based on birth year
        - avoids sorting
- data is stored in the way that it is used
    - data that is used together should be stored together
- upsert, update and insert, default is false
    - if there is a match, then update, if not, insert
