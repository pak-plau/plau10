Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other languages?
  app = Flask(__name__) is similar to the usage of lambda in java.
  app is a variable that is being assigned to a function,
  similar to how you can set a variable to a lambda function.

Q1: What points of reference do you have for the meaning of '/'? Specifically the “/” in @app.route("/")
  Root directory in file systems (/ is the home directory)

Note:
https://ains.co/blog/things-which-arent-magic-flask-part-1.html
the @ is a decorator, a function that takes in a function, and returns a new function.
For @app.route, app.route is the function that is taken in.

Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
  __main__ prints directly to the terminal screen.

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How do you know?
  “No hablo queso” prints to where the code is running,
  if you run the code in terminal, terminal will give you a https:
  link and through this link, you can see “No hablo queso.”

Q4: Where have you seen similar constructs in other languages?
  Many languages use the .run() method to invoke the object that is calling it.
  For example,  Python and various libraries have the .run() method.
  (I have no clue if this is correct lol)

New thoughts after installing and running flask:

Madelyn: I thought it was cool how we can redirect our outputs.
  I’m excited to explore more with Flask and to use it to create web pages.

Matthew: To be honest I had no clue what the code did but then after running it
  and understanding what I was doing along the way,
  things started to make sense and it was super cool to see it display “No hablo queso.”
  
Pak: Did pretty much as I expected, though I did have a hard time properly understanding
  what @app.route did. Very ingenious to view urls like file paths though.
