  Research what <$python3 -m venv ~/myherozero> does
2020-10-02

What it does:
When we ran this command in terminal, there appeared a new directory called myherozero.
Upon entering this directory and listing it’s items, we saw 4 more items:
Madelyn’s contained
  - Bin (directory)
    - Contained a lot of activate files with extensions (.ps1,.csh,.fish)
    - pip(S)
    - Python versions
    - Easy_install(s)
  - Include (directory)
    - empty
  - Lib (directory)
    - Contained python3.8
  - Pyvenv.cfg(not a directory)
    - When I nano-ed into Pyvenv.cfg, I saw three lines, of which stated my python version.

What we know from python manual:
       -m module-name
              Searches  sys.path for the named module and runs the correspond-
              ing .py file as a script.
In this case, module-name is venv.
The ~ is the home directory, and myherozero is the name of the directory created.

Sources we used:
  - Terminal, man python3
  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
