$ represent MQL operators ({<field>: {<operator>: <value>}}) (these are for queries)
    - $eq = equal to
    - $neq = not equal to
    - $gt = greater than
    - $lt = less than
    - $gte = greater than or equal to
    - $lte = less than or equal to
    - similar syntax ({<operator>: [{statement1}, {statement2}, ...]})
        - $and = match all of the specificied query clauses
            - default operator when an operator is not specified
        - $or = at least one query clause is matched
        - $nor = fail to match both given clauses
    - $not = negates query requirement ({$not: {statement}})
    - $expr allows us to use aggregation expressions in the query language, and also use variables and conditional statements
        -$also denotes a field value ("$founded_year")
    - $size = size of an array ({"size": 20})
    - $all = matches arrays that contain the elements mentioned in the query ({"$all": ["Internet", "Wifi", ...]})
    - find() takes in a second argument, which is the projection, it is fields that are shown in the documents that match the find query
    - $elemMatch = matches documents that has arrays that contain the specified queries ({<field>: {$elemMatch: {<query1>, <query2>, ...}}})
    - we can use . notation for arrays ({"start station location.type": "Point"})
    - $regex used for pattern matching strings
