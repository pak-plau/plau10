purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,4,Clearly sacrificing the CSS worked. Great intuitive functionality. Good work

purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,The home button being on all the pages was clever. I like the hello world idea. The realtime edit feature where it keeps you on the edit form is interesting.

purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,Do you set up a user when you set up a blog?

purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,4,5,5,4,5,4,4,3,"While I understood that CSS wasnt required, I think it would've looked nicer and more inviting if you had some kind of greeting on your login/register page.
Nice blog otherwise though!"

purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,I like how the update button updates the page in real-time!

purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,4,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,"I like how you didn't include CSS (makes your site very clean). One thing I would have done differently though is I wouldn't have had the user create a blog when they first register (maybe they only want to view other people's blogs), but to each their own!"

purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,4,3,3,2,4,3,4,2,"I like the way you focused on many cases for signup! Ignoring all CSS though, I still have problems with the UX- mainly not being able to view posts until you click on them. "
purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,I like how you explained your thinking process for how you designed your site.

purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,3,4,4,2,4,3,3,3,I found it kind of weird because the registration also included the blog creation. 
purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,5,5,5,3,5,4,5,4,there were a couple aspects of the UX design that I think could have been more intuitive -- mainly creating blogs on registration and logging users in automatically after they create an account -- but the presentation of the site and the overall functionality looked really good! well done :)
purplesnake__mthaung10_plau10_ywu10,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,3,"Though it looks simple, I appreciate that it completes all the tasks in an efficient manner."
